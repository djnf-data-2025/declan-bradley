A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work immediately at the internship. 

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:
a
Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this analysis on name, image and likeness trends: https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this analysis of environment spill data: https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election data: https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/


Here's what your newsroom suggested for a project:
It will likely be something related to trains -- either the data we have from RailState or databases of NTSB investigations, accidents from the Federal Railroad Administration or similar.

After unzipping, either delete the zip file OR add it to the gitignore for the repo

Declan will need to clone the repo and run the script

The file shared_scripts/database_loading_scripts.rmd walks through the process of downloading the data as a zip file -- it's on a password protected google drive, so we'll need to add declan. I've added you.
The script unzips it 
and then there's some code for loading and accessing the data
