# Dow Jones News Fund Data Journalism and Storytelling Training 2025

As a Dow Jones data intern, I spent my one week training residency at the University of Maryland investigating incidents in which cargo trains carrying high loads of hazardous materials exceeded the maximum safe speed dictated by the Association of American Railroads. I developed the pitch from a large database of rail sensor data, which logs trains at the level of individual cars as they travel across the country. The data was provided to my publication - the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at UMD - by Railstate LLC, a private company that operates thousands of such sensors throughout the American rail network. My investigation focused on ongoing safety violations in East Palestine, OH, where toxic chemicals released during a 2023 derailment continue to impact the daily lives of residents more than two years later.
