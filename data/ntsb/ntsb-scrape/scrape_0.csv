The maintenance crew was using several forms of protection, including inspection clearance, which notifies train operators of maintenance activities, but does not prevent the trains from entering the work area at track speed. The maintenance crew was also using a form of protection called watchman lookout, in which a watchman is assigned who is responsible for warning the maintenance crew of approaching trains. Also, the maintenance crew was using train approach lights that are activated when a train was detected on the track circuit. At the time of the accident, two employees were actively engaged in repairs alongside the watchman lookout. (See figure.) A fourth employee was in the train control room preparing to de-energize a relay to help identify the malfunctioning lights and possible oncoming trains.<br></p><p>​In an interview with National Transportation Safety Board investigators, the watchman said that he was focused on taking apart a light when the train exited the tunnel.

(See figure.) There were no other reported fatalities or injuries. At the time of the accident, and the temperature was 79°F with no precipitation. Although skies were clear with midday light, visibility was impeded by a grove of trees beside the tracks on the southern half of the curve.<br></p><p>​At milepost 46.5, train MCHAL-04 had passed through a wayside defect detector, which detected an issue with the 51st railcar on the train. After receiving a hot-wheel alert from a UP dispatcher at 11&#58;58 a.m., the conductor exited the locomotive, which was stopped on Main Track 1. He then walked across the adjacent Main Track 2 stood on the heads of the rail ties on the east side, and had the locomotive move forward so that he could examine the wheel on the 51st railcar.[1]&#160; As the conductor was waiting to examine the suspected hot wheel, train M338, with the cab car in the leading position, rounded the curve and struck him.[2]<br></p><p>​​Following the accident, on September 5, 2024, UP issued a safety alert to brief their employees on the accident and reinforce the applicable operating/safety rules relevant to the investigation. Since METRA is operated by UP employees, the safety alert was applicable to those employees as well. 
   <br></p><p>While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators conducted inspections of equipment, track, and signals, including the wayside defect detector at milepost 46.5. They also conducted sight distance observations with an exemplar METRA train, reviewed surveillance cameras, event recorders, inward- and outward-facing image recorders, and radio communications. The NTSB also conducted interviews and reviewed the training records, policies, and procedures for both UP and METRA. </p><p>The NTSB’s investigation is ongoing.

This typically happens because of overheating is severe, it can lead to thermal cracking of the wheels. A hot wheel alert is a notification provided to a train crew to inform them that a hot wheel has been detected on the train.&#160;<div>[2] A<em> cab car</em>, also sometimes known as a control car, is a nonpowered rail vehicle from which a train can be operated. Since Metra train M338 was led by the cab car, its approach was not as loud as it may have been had it been led by a locomotive.&#160;</div><div>[3] An <em>adjacent track</em> is one whose center is spaced less than 25 feet from the center of the occupied track.

Contributing to the accident was CSX Transportation’s insufficient training (recurring) and failure to implement operational procedures, such as a restricted speed requirement and secondary verification of switch position, to mitigate the risk of misaligned switch accidents during a signal suspension.​<br></p><p>​<br></p>",,,"<p>​​​​​On April 18, 2024, CSX published a safety alert in response to the collision in Folkston, Georgia. The safety alert discussed operating requirements for dual-controlled, power-operated switches. The alert also emphasized that “all trains must approach all switches within the limits of the signal suspension at restricted speed until it is known they are lined for the authorized and intended route.” This change is intended to give train crews time to stop if they see that they are approaching a misaligned switch. In addition, CSX published a signal suspension safety bulletin that discusses signal suspension job briefing protocols and field management audits and testing. These protocols include secondary switch verification by including a signal maintainer in the job briefing and having the signal maintainer double-check a conductor’s alignment of each switch.<br><br></p><p>This accident underscores the importance of proper switch protocols and train handling under conditions, such as a signal suspension, that prevent automated systems like positive train control from providing an additional margin of safety.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,

About 22 passengers and 3 crew members suffered minor injuries. At the time of this report, NYCT had not estimated the cost of damages. The collision occurred in the underground subway system, so weather was not a factor.</p><p>​Passenger train 1427 comprised 10 railcars and its crew consisted of a conductor and an operator. The train was carrying about 200 passengers at the time of the collision. Train 1345 was also a 10-railcar train, and its crew consisted of a transit system supervisor, an operator (who was acting as a flagger), a conductor, and a railcar inspector.[3]<br></p><p>Before the collision, about 2&#58;11 p.m., an unruly passenger aboard train 1345 triggered an emergency braking application by pulling the emergency brake valve cords on the first five railcars.[4] These emergency brake valve cords are accessible to passengers within each railcar. After the operator of train 1345 was unable to reset the emergency braking application, the operator moved the train to 79th Street Station and offloaded all passengers. A railcar inspector with NYCT arrived on scene but was also unable to reset the brakes, placing the train into bad order (out-of-service) status.[5]<br></p><p>The operations control center instructed the railcar inspector to cut out the brakes and traction motors on the five railcars in the front portion of the train so it could be operated. The inspector was then instructed to move the out-of-service train to a rail yard for repairs. After the railcar inspector performed the cut out, train 1345 departed 79th Street Station at restricted speed, northbound on track 4 toward 96th Street Station, destined for a nearby yard.6 The transit system supervisor was operating the controls of the sixth railcar. The flagger was positioned in the lead railcar and communicating with the transit system supervisor to coordinate the train’s movements. In interviews with National Transportation Safety Board investigators, the flagger said he lost radio communications with the transit system supervisor near 96th Street Station. The transit system supervisor did not receive the flagger’s instruction to stop, the train passed by a signal requiring a stop at the end of the 96th Street Station platform, and the collision occurred. The track in the area was equipped with trip-stops, which activate a train’s emergency brakes if the train passes through a signal requiring a stop. Because the brakes on the first five railcars had been cut out, emergency brakes could not be activated by the trip-stop. </p><p>While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators requested security camera images and radio audio recordings; reviewed signal logs; reviewed​ NYCT operating procedures; conducted sight distance observations; inspected both trains and tested the brakes on the last five railcars of train 1345; tested the portable radios used by the crew of train 1345; and completed interviews.

The train was traveling west at 33 mph and had a train operator and 68 passengers aboard; 8 passengers were in the lead car. At the time of the accident, conditions were dark and clear, and the temperature was 59°F. 
<br></p><p>Main Track 2 was scheduled to be placed out of service at 9&#58;30 p.m. for a crew of contractor and subcontractor employees to put new caulking on columns on a bridge near the track’s third rail. [1]  Skanska Koch, Inc. is the contractor and JPC Group, Inc. is the subcontractor for this long-term construction project on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. This was the crew’s third night of work at that site. Two of the subcontractor employees entered a close-clearance area on Main Track 2 before the track was out of service, and PATCO train Westbound #1 entered their work area too.[2]  Upon identification of the subcontractor employees on the track, the train’s operator initiated emergency braking before striking them. The train’s head end stopped about 100 feet (1.5 railcar lengths) west of where the two subcontractor employees were struck.<br></p><hr />&#160; [1] The third rail is an additional electric current rail used in some railroad systems to supply power to trains.<div>&#160;[2] PATCO defines a close-clearance area as an area where there is no space for a person and a train at the same time. These areas require authorization from the dispatcher to occupy.&#160;&#160;​​</div><div><br><br></div>","<p>​We determined that the probable cause of the accident was the subcontractor employees being on the right-of-way on Main Track 2 before track outage had been established.

The operator reported that he blew the spiker’s horn and looked in the mirror before reversing but did not see the National Salvage contract worker standing behind the spiker.<br><br></p>","<p>​​We determined that the probable cause of the Reed, Pennsylvania, accident was the inability of the spiker operator to see the contract worker behind the spiker and the contract worker not being alerted by the spiker’s nonfunctional horn and change-of-direction alarms. Contributing to the accident was (1) NS’s preshift inspection that did not check the audibility of the spiker’s alerts above ambient noise; (2) Nordco Inc. allowing the spikers to leave the factory without assuring the change-of-direction alarm was working; and (3) insufficient standoff distance chosen by Norfolk Southern Railway that did not provide adequate visibility behind the spiker.<br><br></p>","<p>​We recommended that the Federal Railroad Administration require all new and all rebuilt and remanufactured RMMs to be equipped with backup cameras. We also recommended that all Class I railroads equip new and existing RMMs with backup cameras and that the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association advise its members of this accident and of the importance of adding backup cameras to new and existing RMMs. Furthermore, we recommended that the Federal Railroad Administration inform railroads of the need to determine the appropriate standoff distance for all RMMs.​<br><br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The derailment occurred in a tunnel south of the Rosslyn Station platform. All railcars remained upright and in-line. The passengers and operator were evacuated to Arlington Cemetery Station. No injuries were reported; one passenger was transported to the hospital, treated, and released.</p><p><br></p>","<p>​The derailment occurred because the wheels of one wheelset had migrated outward on their axle, resulting in a width larger than the design specification. The wheel migration happened over time, eventually causing the wheelset to exceed its maximum design width. When this wheelset traveled over a turnout (a type of special track work that allows a train to change tracks), the out-of-specification wheelset width caused a wheel to leave the rail, derailing a railcar.
​<br></p><p>We found that one department within WMATA was aware of wheel migration in its railcar fleet and attempted to mitigate the associated safety risks, but the department did not conduct a trend analysis to monitor the incidence of wheel migration or how effective its mitigations were. A trend analysis would have shown the increasing incidence of wheel migration and made an effective response more likely. WMATA has since made improvements to its safety management systems and has plans to expand its use of trend analysis and related tools to identify and mitigate safety risks before accidents occur. The oversight of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission is vital to supporting and monitoring these ongoing improvements.
</p><p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the derailment of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority train 407 south of Rosslyn Station was an out-of-specification wheelset that caused a wheel to depart the rail at a turnout; the wheelset was out of specification because the wheelset’s design allowed the wheels to migrate outward and eventually exceed the maximum permitted back-to-back measurement.<br></p><p><br></p>","<p>​We recommended that WMATA implement processes and resources to expand its use of trend analysis to identify and mitigate safety risks.

Three passengers were killed and 49 people were injured. The train consisted of 2 locomotives and 10 railcars. Of the eight passenger railcars that derailed, four derailed on their sides, one derailed leaning, and three derailed upright.<br></p><p><br></p>","<p>​The derailment occurred because of a combination of conditions that affected the BNSF Railway track. These conditions included worn rail, vertical track deflection at a four-bolt rail joint, subgrade instability, and track misalignment. Also, we found that had a locomotive equipped with an existing automated vehicle/track interaction monitoring system traveled the derailment curve on the day of the derailment, the deteriorating track conditions could have been identified and BNSF Railway could have been notified, giving it the opportunity to take action to mitigate the dangers of the misaligned track.</p><p>We also found that rail wear limit regulations would have required the worn rail to be replaced before there was wheel flange contact with the four-bolt joint bars. Eight years ago, we recommended that the Federal Railroad Administration revise its Track Safety Standards to require tracks to be repaired if the combination of defects results in a hazardous condition, even if the individual deviations do not constitute a violation.</p><p>We also found that walking inspections are important to ensure an understanding of track conditions and that the track inspector’s workload likely prevented him from performing a timely walking inspection of the track in the area of the derailment. We found that BNSF Railway’s lack of management of workloads for safety-related employees indicates a shortcoming in its safety culture, and that a Fatigue Risk Management Program, as required by the FRA, must account for all job responsibilities, duties, and work hours to mitigate the risk of fatigue.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that performance standards are needed for window retention systems to prevent passenger ejections. We also found that the approach of compartmentalization in&#160; Amtrak’s passenger railcars did not protect the occupants of the overturned railcars from injury during the Joplin derailment.<br></p><p>​We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the derailment of Amtrak Passenger Train 7 on BNSF Railway track was the combination of worn rail, vertical track deflection at a four-bolt rail joint, subgrade instability, and track misalignment. Contributing to the severity of the injuries were the occupant protections that did not restrain passengers in the overturn event and the failure of the window retention systems.<br></p>","<p>​​As a result of this investigation, we recommended that the Federal Railroad Administration require limits for rail head wear, as well as require that the regulations on replacement rail joints be applied to all rail joints in continuously welded rail track without exception. We recommended that the Federal Railroad Administration implement a process where certain alerts from vehicle/track interaction devices automatically trigger a slow order that remains in place until an inspection is completed and the issue is remediated. We recommended that BNSF Railway complete a thorough evaluation of the derailment curve to look for the cause of instability in the subgrade and to make the appropriate repairs once the cause is determined. We also recommended that all Class I and intercity railroad trains operating on main tracks be equipped with a technology-based monitoring system to detect track defects earlier, reducing the likelihood of train derailments.&#160;</p><p>We reiterated existing recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration regarding occupant protection and reiterated and gave new classifications to existing recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration to address combinations of track conditions and the&#160;protection of occupants within passenger railcars.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;​​<br></p>",Jim Southworth,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The employee was found by an NYCT car inspector who then radioed management of the unresponsive employee between tracks 52 and 53. The unresponsive employee was identified as a transit car cleaner (CTA).  Emergency medical services personnel were notified, arrived on the scene, and declared the CTA employee deceased.</p><p>The CTA was found lying near a light pole and several current collector assemblies mounted on nearby rail transit cars.&#160;Current collectors draw power from an electrified rail (third rail) on NYCT’s transit system, and, should any current collector from a train be in contact with the third rail, then all assemblies on every car, even those not in contact with the rail, have the potential to be energized by electric current. The nearest current collector was about 12 inches from the light pole. Electric current collectors are used by trolley buses, trams, or electric locomotives to carry electrical power from overhead lines or electrical third rails to the electrical equipment of the vehicles.
</p><p>​The CTA was found wearing an NYCT-issued reflective safety vest and safety boots and was in possession of his assigned cleaning equipment. His cleaning equipment and radio were observed laying in the immediate area he was found. The radio was in the on position; however, the battery was depleted. The CTA’s flashlight and red flags were not accounted for.
<br></p><p>Tracks 52 and 53, located in NYCT’s 239th Street Yard, were occupied by several transit cars at the time of the accident.

One of the derailed railcars struck the bridge structure, and part of the bridge collapsed, dropping railcars and bridge structure onto Rio Salado Parkway below and temporarily shutting down the road. Five of the derailed railcars were DOT-111 tank cars carrying various hazardous materials.[2] Two of these tank cars, both carrying UN1915 cyclohexanone, a flammable hazardous material, fell from the bridge during the​ ​​derailment; the rest remained in-line with the track. [3] One of the fallen DOT-111 tank cars released about 2,200 gallons of cyclohexanone, creating a pool of hazardous material below the damaged bridge. The cyclohexanone did not ignite, and no other tank cars were breached. Derailed lumber cars, which remained on the bridge, caught fire during the derailment. Some lumber fell onto and near the road, where it burned for several hours. (See figure 1.) There were no fatalities; one firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation at the scene. UP estimated the damage costs to be about $485,000 for railroad equipment, $435,000 for track and structures, and $10 million for the bridge.​​<br></p><hr /><ol><li>​​(a) Visit <a href=""/Pages/home.aspx"">ntsb.gov </a>to find additional information in the <a href=""https&#58;//data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Forms/searchdocket"">public docket</a> for this NTSB investigation (case number RRD20LR005).

In the 2 weeks before the derailment, the area where the derailment occurred received more than 300 percent of its normal amount of rainfall, which prompted the mudslide that covered the track with mud and debris immediately before the derailment. Three leading locomotives, a buffer car, and four tank cars located at the front of the train derailed. Two of the derailed tank cars breached and released 38,400 gallons of denatured ethanol, which combined with diesel fuel from the locomotives and ignited. The locomotives were destroyed by the ensuing fire, and the train crew was able to evacuate through the river and sustained minor injuries.<br>
</p><p></p>","<p>We determined that the probable cause of the February 13, 2020, derailment&#160;of CSX Transportation train K42911 was loose mud, vegetation, sand, soil, and rock from a mudslide that obstructed the track following excessive rain accumulation over several weeks. Contributing to the derailment was CSX Transportation’s use of a weather alert system in which notifications were developed and implemented that did not account for the impact of the unusual increases and accumulation of precipitation. Contributing to the severity of the derailment was a fire resulting from the release of hazardous materials from breached US Department of Transportation-111 tank cars damaged in the derailment. Also contributing to the severity of the derailment was the failure of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to withdraw regulatory interpretation 06-0278 that pertains to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations 174.85, which allowed the use of a single buffer railcar between the locomotives and the first tank car containing hazardous materials if no other nonhazardous materials cars are available in the consist.​​​<br></p>","<p>We made recommendations to the Class I Railroads and Amtrak, ​​American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association and the American Public Transportation Association.

Train 9 had 1 operator and 27 passengers on board. The test train had one operator and two contractors on board. Thirteen people were transported to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Neither train derailed, and both trains experienced minimal structural damage. SacRT estimated damage to be $242,450.<br></p>",<p>​We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the collision of two Sacramento Regional Transit District light rail trains was the Sacramento Regional Transit District’s weak administrative controls that allowed the transportation supervisor to authorize a high-speed test train to enter the mainline without knowing the location of passenger train 9 on the same track. Contributing to the collision was senior management’s failure to assess the transportation supervisor’s competency in the combined role as both a controller and dispatcher on the evening shift.</p>,"<p>We made recommendations to SacRT to do the following&#58; ensure employee performance is monitored and evaluated while on a performance improvement plan for the intended duration of the plan or until the employee has demonstrated competency in the position they occupy; conduct a risk assessment of mainline high-speed testing and revise testing schedules and communication requirements to ensure that necessary controls are in place; improve the train delay reporting process; and install a transmission-based train control system.

The conductor was riding on the side of the leading railcar of train 38A during a reverse movement when he was pinned between the railcar he was riding and a stationary railcar on an adjacent track.</p><p>On the morning of the accident, after uncoupling all but four railcars, the train’s engineer notified the yardmaster by radio that the train was secured and asked to move the train to its next switching location. The yardmaster reminded the engineer that the conductor was not allowed to ride on the side of railcars within the intermodal facility tracks and subsequently approved the train’s movement. As the train reversed north, the lead railcar, on which the conductor was riding, approached a slight right curve where three railcars had been stored on an adjacent track. When the train entered the curve, the distance between the train and stored railcars decreased to 9 inches. As the train continued to reverse, the engineer passed the conductor lying between both tracks. The engineer stopped the train and radioed the yardmaster to report that the conductor was down and that emergency assistance was needed.<br></p>","<p>We determined​&#160;that the probable cause of the fatality was the conductor riding on the side of a railcar for unknown reasons as the moving train approached stored railcars on an adjacent track, which resulted in decreased clearance, in a section of the Bayview Yard where Norfolk Southern Corporation’s terminal instructions and operating rules specifically prohibited riding railcars in the close-clearance restriction areas.<br></p>","<p>​As a result of this investigation, we made a recommendation to Norfolk Southern Corporation to review and revise the terminal instructions in the Harrisburg Division Timetable 1 that govern the close-clearance restriction locations within the Baltimore Consolidated Terminal and ensure the instructions contain consistent language related to close-clearance locations. We also recommended that Norfolk Southern Corporation revise the Baltimore Consolidated Terminal training and testing program to emphasize close-clearance restriction locations and location-specific hazards.​​​<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accident occurred at the North End Estill Siding switch, milepost (MP) S-449.7, on the CSX Columbia subdivision in Estill, South Carolina. The welder was occupying the track as the train approached. An additional roadway worker, a trackman, was at the work location and had been assigned to serve as a watchman, which involved watching for approaching trains and providing a warning to the welder.&#160;The crewmembers of train F-794-30 told National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators that they did not realize that a person was on the track until moments before impact. The crew of train F-794-30 sounded the train horn and bell; however, there was no response from the roadway work group.<br></p>","<p>​We determined that the probable cause of the roadway worker fatality in Estill, South Carolina, was the failed implementation of train approach warning. Contributing to the accident were&#58; (1) the decision by CSX Transportation management to use train approach warning instead of establishing working limits, (2) the decision by the watchman to cease his train detection and warning efforts to engage in other work while the welder was still working on an active track, and (3) the decision of the welder to remove his high-visibility safety apparel before leaving the work site.​<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The striking train consisted of 3 leading locomotives and 105 railcars. The locomotive engineer and conductor of the striking train were killed, and 3 locomotives and railcars 1 through 57 of the striking train derailed while the rear 5 railcars and the railcars positioned 8, 9, and 10 from the rear of the stationary train derailed. Damage was estimated by Union Pacific Railroad to be $3.2 million.</p><p>As the train descended the grade, the locomotive engineer initiated a full-service brake application, however, the train’s speed continued to increase. At milepost 529.95 the train was still accelerating, reaching 28 mph when the locomotive engineer initiated an emergency brake application. The event recorder indicated that information was being transmitted between the controlling locomotive and the rear railcar via a telemetry link for the previous 45 minutes. After the emergency brake application, the status of the communications system changed to “FR NC,” which means front-to-rear no communication. The emergency brake request was not received at the end-of-train device, which would have initiated an emergency brake application at the rear of the train. Five minutes after the locomotive engineer initiated the emergency brake application, the end-of-train device still had not received the emergency brake request, and the train collided with the standing train at about 55 mph at milepost 527.1. Prior to the collision, the crew of the striking Union Pacific Railroad freight train reported problems with the train’s air brake system and radioed the Union Pacific Railroad Harriman Dispatch Center to advise that they had accelerated to 51 mph and were unable to stop. The Union Pacific Railroad Harriman Dispatch Center notified the crew of Union Pacific freight train MPCNP03 and advised them to evacuate the train to avoid possible injury from the runaway train.<br></p>","<p>We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the collision was the failure of the Union Pacific train MGRCY04 air brake system due to an air flow restriction in the brake pipe and the failure of the end-of-train device to respond to an emergency brake command. Contributing to the accident was the failure of Union Pacific Railroad to maintain the railcars in accordance with federal regulations, including regularly performing single railcar air brake tests. Further contributing to the accident were communication protocols, set by Federal Railroad Administration regulations and industry standards, that allowed extended time intervals for loss of communication notification between the head-of-train device and the end-of-train device without warning the train crew of the loss of communication.​<br></p>","<p>​We made new recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration and the Association of American Railroads, the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association and the Association of American Railroads.<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work train was making an eastbound reverse move to drop off an employee before traveling west to exit the main track. The collision occurred on main track 1 at milepost 480.2 in an area known as Crozier Canyon, about 33 miles east of Kingman, Arizona. The collision resulted in the death of one contract (Herzog Railroad Services, Inc.) employee who was traveling on the work train. Another Herzog employee was air lifted to a hospital in Las Vegas with serious injuries.</p><p>​The loaded eastbound work train consisted of 29 cars and 2 forward-facing locomotives, was 1,800 feet long, and weighed 3,830 tons. After unloading rail on main track 1, the train headed east to drop off an employee. The work train was traveling up a 1.5 percent grade at about 9 mph on main track 1, approaching an 8° (sharp) curve at Crozier Canyon when the rail unloading machine on the rear of the work train and the lead locomotive of the westbound intermodal train collided.</p><p>The westbound intermodal train consisted of one forward-facing locomotive and two rear-facing locomotives at the front of the train and 72 loaded cars, was 6,574 feet long, and weighed 8,186 tons. After assuming the work train was headed west based on radio transmissions, the westbound intermodal train crew decided to proceed past a red restrictive signal at a speed slow enough, but not exceeding 15 mph, to permit stopping short of a train, a car, an obstruction, a stop signal, a derail, or an improperly lined switch. The train traversed a descending 1.5 percent grade reaching a top speed of 15 mph prior to reaching the 8° curve at Crozier Canyon, where tall trees on the inside of the curve impaired visibility. Both trains were operating with positive train control.​​​​<br></p>",<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the BNSF Railway train crew of the intermodal train to operate in accordance with restricted speed requirements and stop short of the opposing train. Contributing to the accident was (1) BNSF Railway’s failure to establish sufficient on-track safety and (2) the Federal Railroad Administration’s interpretation of Title 49 <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i>​ Part 214 Subpart C that allows work trains to lay rail without using a form of on-track safety.</p>,"<p>​​​​As a result of the investigation, we mad​es two safety recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accident occurred on main track 1 at milepost 119.2 on the Philadelphia to Washington line, located on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor. At the time of the accident, main track 2 was out of service under a continuous track outage for track maintenance, and the adjacent tracks immediately to the east and west of main track 2 (main tracks 1 and 3, respectively) were in service for train movements. Three watchmen were protecting the roadway workers and watching for trains moving on adjacent tracks to warn workers of approaching trains. One watchman was positioned near the boarding platform, another was positioned in a nearby curve, and the third watchman was positioned toward the end of the curve, near a work gang of welders. The third watchman was the employee struck by the train. No passengers or crewmembers on Amtrak train 86 were injured.<br></p><p>Amtrak train 86 departed Washington, D.C.’s Union Station about 8&#58;40 a.m., destined for New York’s Penn Station.

Immediately before Amtrak train 86 arrived at the work zone, Maryland Area Rail Commuter train 421 was traveling southbound through the work zone on main track 3, preparing to service the southbound passenger platform at the Bowie State Train Station. When Amtrak train 86 passed the Bowie State Train Station on main track 1, the engineer noticed that the rail gang watchman was standing too close to the track’s edge, facing the roadway workers on main track 2 and the passing Maryland Area Rail Commuter train on main track 3. He was not looking toward Amtrak train 86’s approach and did not respond to the horn from the train nor the warnings from the other watchmen. The engineer applied emergency train braking, slowing the train to 98 mph, before striking and killing the rail gang watchman.&#160;<br></p>","<p>​The probable cause of the Bowie accident was Amtrak’s insufficient site-specific safety work plan for the Bowie project that (1) did not consider the multiple main tracks in a high noise environment and (2) did not provide the rail gang watchman with a safe place to stand with level footing and sufficient sight distance to perform his duties, which led the rail gang watchman to stand on an active track in a work zone in the path of Amtrak train 86.

The weather at the time of the accident was 79°F with light rain.<br></p>","<p>The probable cause of this accident was an intermittent anomaly in the braking system of car 155 that degraded its stopping performance on approach to the 69th Street Transportation Center station, resulting in the collision with car 148.​​<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,CSX Train Derailment with Hazardous Materials Release,2017-08-02T04:00:00Z,39.826367,-78.722050,Closed,,,,,,,,"<p>​On August 2, 2017, at 4&#58;54 a.m., local time, 33 rail cars on CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX) train Q38831 derailed in Hyndman Borough, Bedford County, Pennsylvania. The train consisted of 5 locomotives and a total of 178 cars (128 loaded and 50 empty), including derailed cars 53 through 65. Three derailed tank cars containing hazardous materials were breached, resulting in a fire. Three homes were damaged by the derailment and subsequent fire. There was no loss of life or injuries. A 1-mile radius evacuation zone was established, which affected about 1,000 residents, and several highway-railroad grade crossings were closed. The evacuation was lifted about 12&#58;00 p.m. on August 5. CSX reported $1.8 million in damages for the derailed equipment and $60,000 in damages to the track structure.​<br></p><p><a href=""https&#58;//flic.kr/s/aHsm2gS8U9"" style=""background-color&#58;#f2f3f4;"">See the photos on Flickr</a><br></p>","<p>​We&#160;determined&#160;the probable cause of the accident was the inappropriate use of hand brakes on empty rail cars to control train speed and the placement of blocks of empty rail cars at the front of the train consist, leading to elevated longitudinal forces and increased lateral forces at the wheel-rail interface at the curve in the rail on the leading 42 cars combined with tread buildup on the 35th car, which was the first to derail. Contributing to the derailment were CSX operating practices that accepted the use of hand brakes on empty rail cars to control train speed and allowed blocks of empty rail cars to be placed at the front of the train consist.​<br></p>","<p>​We made recommendations to the Federal Railraod Administration, CSX Transportation, The Association of American Railroads and to the Security and Emergency Response Training Center.<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,CSX Transportation Employee Fatalities at Ivy City,2017-06-27T04:00:00Z,38.893709,-77.0847869,Closed,,,,,,,,"<p>​​On June 27, 2017, at 11&#58;18 p.m. eastern daylight time, two CSX Transportation (CSX)&#160;employees (conductor and conductor trainee) were struck and killed by southbound Amtrak (National Railroad Passenger Corporation) train P175 at Amtrak milepost (MP) 134.5 in Ivy City,&#160;a small neighborhood in Northeast Washington, DC.&#160;The two employees were on the track walking toward the front of their southbound train after inspecting a railcar with elevated temperature reported by a track-side detector. Their backs were to the approaching southbound Amtrak train when they were struck. At the time of the accident, the sky was clear; visibility was 10 miles, and the temperature was 64°F. Additional ambient lighting was provided by a nearby Amtrak maintenance yard.</p>​​<br>",<p>​​We determin​ed that the probable cause of the accident was the CSX Transportation train Q137 crew’s decision to walk near an active track without protection. Contributing to the accident was their focus on northbound Amtrak train P66 and their failure to realize Amtrak train P175 was approaching them from behind.<br></p>,<p>​We&#160;made a recommendation to&#160;CSX Transportation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.​​​<br></p>,,,,,,,,,,,,/advocacy/safety-alerts/Documents/SA-078.pdf,,

A fifth roadway worker was clear of the tracks, keeping pace with the work group. Upon seeing train 7623, the watchman/lookout sounded a handheld horn, yelled at the other workmen, and raised a disc that told the locomotive engineer to sound the train’s horn. The locomotive engineer then sounded the train’s horn. Three of the roadway workers remained in track 1, but the foreman stepped into the path of the train on track 3 and was killed. The train was traveling about 78 mph when the locomotive engineer applied the emergency brakes just before impact.<br></p>","<p>The probable cause of the accident was Long Island Rail Road’s decision to use train approach warning to protect the roadway workers on active tracks. Contributing to the accident was Long Island Rail Road’s and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers’ allowance of overtime work schedules without properly considering and mitigating workers’ risk of fatigue.<br></p>","<p>​We made recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration​, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority​, and&#160;the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers.

99,Derailment of Metro-North Railroad Commuter Train,2017-05-18T04:00:00Z,40.9459277,-73.6993178,Closed,,,,,,,,"<p>​On May 18, 2017, at 4&#58;56 p.m. eastern daylight time, westbound Metro-North Railroad (Metro-North) commuter train 1373 derailed at milepost (MP) 24.55 near catenary bridge 215 on main track 3 of the Metro-North New Haven Line in Rye, New York.&#160;Train 1373 originated from Stamford, Connecticut, and was destined for Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, New York, when 5 of the 12 cars in the consist derailed. Train 1373 had 185 passengers, of which 12 passengers suffered minor injuries. Four crewmembers (one conductor and three assistant conductors) also reported minor injuries.
</p><p>At the time of the accident, the National Weather Service reported wind from the west at about 17 mph, visibility unrestricted at 10 miles, temperature of 93°F, and dew point 63°F. No precipitation had been reported during the previous 24 hours; the high temperature was 94°F, and the low temperature was 71°F. Above normal temperatures were reported on May 17 and 18, 2017.</p>","<p>​We determined&#160;that the probable cause of this derailment was the engineer of Metro-North Railroad commuter train 1373 failing to remember the 10-mph temporary speed restriction and operating his train at 55.9 mph into a 10-mph speed-restricted area. Contributing to the accident was the engineer’s failure to communicate the temporary speed restriction to the conductor who could have reminded the train engineer of the upcoming speed restriction. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of a fully operational positive train control system, which would have stopped the train in advance of the speed-restricted area.​<br></p>",<p>​We made recommendations to the Metro-North Railroad.<br><br></p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
