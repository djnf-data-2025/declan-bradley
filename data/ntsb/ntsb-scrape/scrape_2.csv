0,Rail Grinder Derailment on Union Pacific Railroad,2006-11-09T05:00:00Z,39.203232,-120.793877,Closed,,,,,,,,"<p>​About 11&#58;00 a.m.&#160;on November 9, 2006, a Harsco Track Technologies (Harsco) rail grinder&#160;was moving on the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) when it derailed near Baxter, California. The rail grinder consisted of 2 modified locomotives and 11 specialized rail cars. Ten of the cars derailed. One UP conductor-pilot, one Harsco subcontractor cook, and eight Harsco employees, including one supervisor, were on board at the time of the accident. Two of the Harsco employees were killed. A fire broke out in the wreckage following the derailment. Monetary damage to the equipment and track was estimated to be $3.33 million.<br></p>","<p>​We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the November 9, 2006, derailment of the Harsco Track Technologies rail grinder was the failure of the braking system due to ineffective preaccident maintenance, inspections, and testing and the inappropriate brake recharging technique used by the A-end operator. A contributing factor was the failure of the Federal Railroad Administration to provide adequate safety oversight of rail grinders.​<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The train consisted of a three-unit locomotive pulling 3 empty freight cars followed by 83 tank cars loaded with denatured ethanol, a flammable liquid. Twenty-three of the tank cars derailed near the east end of the bridge, with several of the cars falling into the Beaver River. Of the 23 derailed tank cars, about 20 released ethanol, which subsequently ignited and burned for about 48 hours. Some of the unburned ethanol liquid was released into the river and the surrounding soil. Homes and businesses within a seven-block area of New Brighton and in an area adjacent to the accident were evacuated for 2 days. No injuries or fatalities resulted from the accident. The Norfolk Southern Railway Company estimated total damages to be $5.8 million.&#160;<br></p>",<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the derailment of Norfolk Southern Railway Company train 68QB119 ​was the Norfolk Southern Railway Company’s inadequate rail inspection and maintenance program that resulted in a rail fracture from an undetected internal defect.

About 1,000 passengers were on board the eight-car rapid transit train. Following the derailment, the train came to a stop, and electrical arcing between the last car and the 600-volt direct current third rail generated smoke. The single operator in the lead car received a number of calls on the train intercom. The operator exited the control compartment, stepped onto the catwalk, and walked beside the train to investigate.</p><p>Electrical power was removed from the third rail, and most passengers walked to an emergency exit stairway about 350 feet in front of the train that led to the street level. Some passengers had to be assisted in their evacuation by emergency responders. The Chicago Fire Department reported that 152 persons were treated and transported from the scene. There were no fatalities. Total damage exceeded $1 million.<br></p>","<p>We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the July 11, 2006, derailment of Chicago Transit Authority train number 220 in the subway in Chicago, Illinois, was the Chicago Transit Authority’s ineffective management and oversight of its track inspection and maintenance program and its system safety program, which resulted in unsafe track conditions. Contributing to the accident were the Regional Transportation Authority’s failure to require that action be taken by the Chicago Transit Authority to correct unsafe track conditions and the Federal Transit Administration’s ineffective oversight of the Regional Transportation Authority. Contributing to the seriousness of the accident was smoke in the tunnel and the delay in removing that smoke.​​</p>","<p>​We made ​safety recommendations to the Federal Transit Administration, the State of Illinois, the Regional Transportation Authority, the Chicago Transit Board, and the Chicago Transit Authority.​​</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The southbound train was traveling about 11 mph when it struck the northbound train. As a result of the collision, the control cab car and two passenger cars on the southbound train and the control cab car on the northbound train were derailed. Thirty-eight passengers were injured and treated on scene. Of those, 29 were transported to local hospitals, and 8 were admitted. All six crewmembers from both trains were also taken to local hospitals; three of them were admitted. Total property damage was about $179,700.&#160;</p>","<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the July 1, 2006, collision of two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority passenger trains near Abington, Pennsylvania, was the failure of the engineer on southbound train 1143 to comply with the wayside signals and stop the train on the main track at the Grove South Control Point. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a functioning cab signal system with automatic train control enforcement. Also contributing to the accident was a dispatcher computer alarm system that did not adequately alert the train dispatcher to the overrun signal.​</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Operation of Amtrak Passenger Train Over CN Misaligned Track,2006-06-26T04:00:00Z,30.776617,-90.509600,Closed,,,,,,,,"<p>​​About 3&#58;25 p.m. on June 26, 2006, National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) train PO5871-26, en route from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Chicago, Illinois, and operating over CN railroad (CN) main line track, encountered a section of misaligned track near Arcola, Louisiana.&#160;The train was traveling about 67 mph when the engineer said he saw that the track ahead was misaligned by about 2 feet to the east. He made an immediate full service brake application,&#160;and although the train negotiated the area without derailing, the misaligned track caused passengers to be jostled about in the cars. Nine of the train’s 104 passengers reported injuries at the scene, and 4 were transported to a local hospital where they were treated and released. None of the 10 Amtrak employees aboard the train was injured.<br></p>","<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the June 26, 2006, accident near Arcola, Louisiana, involving Amtrak train PO5871-26 was a heat-induced track misalignment that resulted because CN railroad’s continuous welded rail procedures failed to ensure that rail was adequately de-stressed during or after the installation of a turnout.​</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The employee was an automatic train control system mechanic who had been working with two other mechanics at the interlocking2 just north of the Dupont Circle station. All three mechanics had moved between the two main tracks north of the interlocking in order to stay clear of a northbound train that was leaving the station. As the southbound accident train was arriving, the other two mechanics remained in the clear between the two trains as they passed and were not injured. According to signal system data logs, the southbound train was moving about 40 mph as it traveled past the interlocking.<br></p>","<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the Dupont Circle accident was the failure of the automatic train control system (senior) mechanic to stay clear of the approaching southbound train either because he was not aware of the presence of the train or because he lacked a physical reference by which to identify a safe area outside the train’s dynamic envelope. Contributing to the accident were Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail right-of-way rules and procedures that did not provide adequate safeguards to protect the wayside personnel from approaching trains, that did not ensure that train operators were aware of wayside work being performed, and that did not adequately ​provide for reduced train speeds through work areas. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of an aggressive program of rule compliance testing and enforcement on the Metrorail system.&#160;​</p>",<p>​We made recommendations to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.<br></p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collision resulted in the puncture of a railroad tank car containing propylene, a compressed flammable gas. The propylene was heavier than air and flowed near the ground into a nearby neighborhood. The flowing gas reached a house where an unknown ignition source ignited the gas, and the house exploded. The single occupant was killed. The fire moved quickly along the flowing gas back to the punctured tank car. A second, unoccupied, home was destroyed in the fire, and a wooden railroad trestle burned completely. Approximately 3,000 residents within a 1-mile radius of the punctured tank car were advised to evacuate the area.

He had been walking on the track with his back to the approaching train. He had been preparing to move a tamper machine. The train was cleared through the work limits at 40 mph.</p><p>Throughout the day, the UP employee-in-charge notified several designated safety coordinators of approaching trains. In turn, the coordinators notified the workers for whom they were responsible. However, earlier in the year, the tamper operators had made an agreement with their safety coordinator that they did not need to be notified directly about approaching trains. They believed that (1) their equipment did not normally enter an area that could be struck by a train passing on an adjacent track and (2) they would monitor the radio in the cab of the tampers and would be aware of approaching trains when the coordinator notified other members of the work crew. On the day of the accident, the tamper operator who was struck by the train was not inside the cab to listen to the radio when the crews were notified of the approaching train. He was walking along the adjacent track with his back to the striking train.<br></p>",<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the accident was the agreement among the employees that they did not need to be notified of approaching trains as required by rule and regulation.

Contributing to the severity of the injuries to the train operator was the disproportionate amount of crush sustained by the lead cars of the colliding trains.​​</p>","<p>We made&#160;recommendations to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the Federal Transit Administration, the American Public Transit Association, the Montgomery County (Maryland) Fire and Rescue Commission, and all jurisdictions providing primary and secondary response to Metrorail accidents or incidents.​​</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
