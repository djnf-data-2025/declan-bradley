Fourteen of the derailed tank cars released about 322,000 gallons of undenatured ethanol, fueling a postaccident fire.&#160;The accident occurred near Jack Creek, a tributary of the Des Moines River. There were no injuries and three nearby homes were evacuated. About 400 feet of railroad track and a 152-foot railroad bridge were destroyed in the accident. UP estimated damages at $4 million.&#160;At the time of the accident, the wind was from the northwest at 17 mph gusting to 30 mph, visibility was 10 miles, and the temperature was 10°F. Figure 1 shows an aerial view of the accident.<br></p>",<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the derailment was a broken rail that occurred as the train was traveling over the west approach of the Jack Creek Bridge resulting from Union Pacific Railroad’s inadequate track maintenance and inspection program and the Federal Railroad Administration’s inadequate oversight of the application of federal track safety standards. Contributing to the consequences of this accident was the continued use of US Department of Transportation Specification-111 tank cars.<br></p>,"<p>​We made new recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and to Union Pacific Railroad and reiterated a recommendation to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accident occurred at milepost 477, on the Black Hills subdivision, in Edgemont, South Dakota. The three-member roadway work group had been cleaning snow and ice from the track switch on the main track to prepare for the movement of a train that was to have its air brake system tested in a stationary test on the main track. The crew of the striking train sounded the train horn and bell, and both members of the train crew applied emergency braking; however, there was no response from the roadway work group, and the train was unable to stop before reaching the work location. At the time of the accident, the sky was clear, the wind was calm, and reported temperatures ranged from 13° to 18°F.</p><p>The accident occurred in the west leg of the Deadwood wye switch. Train movements on the main tracks in this area are controlled by centralized traffic control and governed by operating rules, general orders, timetable instructions, and the signal indications of an absolute block system.
</p><p>The Black Hills subdivision consisted of two main tracks. The maximum operating speed was 35 mph between milepost 476.1 and milepost 477.0 on both main tracks. About 20 eastbound and 20 westbound trains per day operated on the main tracks through the accident area. There were multiple main tracks in this area with eastbound trains typically operating on main track 2 and westbound trains operating on main track 1.&#160;<br></p>","<p>​The probable cause of the accident was the improper use of train approach warning by the BNSF Railway roadway work group to provide on-track safety. Contributing to the accident was incorrect information provided in the job briefing, including a miscalculated sight-distance assessment. Also contributing to the accident was the failure of BNSF Railway to provide the watchman/lookout with the necessary equipment to alert the work group of oncoming trains and equipment.

Damage was estimated at $5.3 million. The accident occurred inside the terminal and was not affected by the weather.<br></p>","<p>​We determined the probable cause of the Brooklyn, New York, accident was that the engineer of Long Island Rail Road train 2817 fell asleep due to his chronic fatigue. Contributing to his chronic fatigue was the engineer’s severe undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, and Long Island Rail Road’s failure to initiate obstructive sleep apnea screening for safety-sensitive personnel and refer at-risk safety-sensitive personnel for definitive obstructive sleep apnea testing and treatment before the accident. Further contributing to the accident was the Federal Railroad Administration’s failure to require railroads to medically screen employees in safety-sensitive positions for obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of either a device or a safety system that could have intervened to stop the train before the collision.​​<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The train was authorized to operate on main track 3 (track 3) at the maximum authorized speed of 110 mph. Beginning on the morning of April 1, Amtrak had scheduled track-bed restoration―ballast vacuuming—at milepost 15.7 on track 2 on the Philadelphia to Washington Line. Track 2 had to be taken out of service between control points Baldwin (milepost 11.7) and Hook (milepost 16.8) for the 55-hour duration of the project. As train 89 approached milepost 15.7, the locomotive engineer saw equipment and workers on and near track 3 and initiated an emerg​​ency brake application. The train speed was 106 mph before the emergency brake application and 99 mph when it struck the backhoe. Two roadway workers were killed, and 39 other people were injured. Amtrak estimated property damages to be $2.5 million.<br></p>","<p>​The probable cause of the accident was the unprotected fouled track that was used to route a passenger train at maximum authorized speed; the absence of supplemental shunting devices, which Amtrak required but the foreman could not apply because he had none; and the inadequate transfer of job site responsibilities between foremen during the shift change that resulted in failure to clear the track, to transfer foul time, and to conduct a job briefing. Allowing these unsafe actions to occur were the inconsistent views of safety and safety management throughout Amtrak’s corporate structure that led to the company’s deficient system safety program that resulted in part from Amtrak’s inadequate collaboration with its unions and from its failure to prioritize safety. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Railroad Administration’s failure to require redundant signal protection, such as shunting, for maintenance-of-way work crews who depend on the train dispatcher to provide signal protection, prior to the accident.​<br></p>","<p>We made safety recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division, American Railway and Airway Supervisors Association, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen.

The trains collided at a diamond crossing (Texarkana Interlocking) of the two subdivisions.2 Two locomotives of the striking train and seven cars (numbers 13–19) of the struck train derailed. The engineer and conductor of the striking train sustained minor injuries; neither crewmember in the struck train was injured. The lead locomotive of the striking train released about 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The locomotive event recorder data indicated the striking train was traveling at 19 mph when the engineer made an emergency brake application. At the time of the collision, the train had slowed to about 6 mph. The estimated damage was $4.66 million.

The lead car rode over the bumping post and went up an escalator at the end of the track. The escalator provided public access to enter O'Hare International Airport from the platform in the station, but no one was using it at the time of the accident. About 50 people were on the train at the time of the accident. Thirty-three injured passengers and the injured train operator were taken to the hospital. The estimated damage was $11,196,796. The accident occurred in an underground station that was not impacted by weather conditions.<br>​</p>","<p>​​​The probable cause of the accident was the failure of the train operator to stop the train at the appropriate signal due to falling asleep as a result of fatigue, which was the result of the challenges of working shiftwork, circadian factors, and acute sleep loss resulting from her ineffective off-duty time management. In addition, Chicago Transit Authority failed to effectively manage the operator's work schedule to mitigate the risk of fatigue. Contributing to the severity of the accident was Chicago Transit Authority's failure to identify the insufficient stopping distance and inadequate speed restriction at the center pocket track at O'Hare Station.<br></p>","<p>​​As a result of this investigation, we made six safety recommendations to the Federal Transit Administration and one safety recommendation to the Chicago Transit Authority.​​<br></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conductor appeared to have been pinched between the knuckle of the stationary car that was coupled to the train and the drawbar carrier of the free rolling car that he was attempting to couple. At the time of the accident, the weather was mostly cloudy; the temperature was 76˚F.<br></p>",<p>​​We determined that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the conductor to apply the necessary protections before he stepped between the cars to adjust the drawbars​. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the BRC’s lack of an effective efficiency testing program to periodically observe and enforce its safety and operating rules for switching movements.​​​<br></p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
