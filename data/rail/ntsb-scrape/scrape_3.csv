The collision occurred on the Williamsburg Bridge about 16 feet south of signal J2-125 on the Brooklyn Borough side of the Bridge. The operator of the J train was fatally injured in the collision. Sixty-nine people, including two emergency responders, were treated at area hospitals for serious or minor injuries.<br></p>",<p>​​We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the J train operator to comply with the stop indication because he was asleep and the failure of the train to stop within the block because of inadequate braking distance between signals on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1,Collision and Derailment of Two Subway Trains Metropolitan Transportation Authority New York City Transit,1995-02-09T05:00:00Z,40.633363,-74.008415,Closed,,,,,,,,"<p>​On February 9, 1995, at 2&#58;39 p.m., a Metropolitan Transportation Authority/New York City Transit (NYCT)1 northbound M line route subway (M) train collided with the rear car of a stopped NYCT B line route subway (B) train in Brooklyn, New York. The 10-car B train in passenger service had departed the Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn about 2&#58;20 p.m. en route to 168th Street station in Manhattan, New York. The crew consisted of a train operator and conductor. The conductor stated that the last station stop before the collision was the Fort Hamilton Parkway (Fort Hamilton) station in Brooklyn. The operator stopped the train after departing that station at signal D2-518, which displayed a stop signal because a preceding northbound M train was stopped in the Ninth Avenue station in Brooklyn. The train operator stated that after waiting about 3 minutes, he felt a tremendous impact that threw him toward the window. The conductor stated he had no warning of the impending collision, which occurred on the elevated track about 1,011 feet south of the Ninth Avenue station. (See figure 2.) He assisted the passengers during the train evacuation after the collision along the elevated walkway to the Ninth Avenue station. The crew, an off-duty employee, and 11 of the 150 passengers on the B train as well as the M train operator sustained minor injuries.​<br></p>",<p>​​We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the rear-end collision between the two subway trains was the inadequate oversight and compliance program of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority/New York City Transit to ensure that train operators comply with the published operating rules. Contributing to the collision was the design modification to the automatic key-by feature of the automatic stop arm that enabled the operator of the M train to pass a stop signal contrary to the published operating rules that require stopping at a red signal unless permission to pass is granted by Rapid Transit Operations.&#160;​</p>,<p>​We&#160;​made recommendations to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the&#160;​New York City Transit.<br></p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
