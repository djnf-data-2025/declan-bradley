The engineer, responding to a hand lamp signal from the foreman, accelerated the locomotive, with a caboose, an empty freight car, and a loaded tank car coupled ahead. The loaded tank car impacted a fourth car at a speed of about 10-12 mph. Upon impact, the end sill of the fourth car (empty boxcar) rode over the coupler of the (loaded tank car) and punctured the tank head. Nitric acid spilled from the car and formed a vapor cloud which dispersed over the area. As a result, 9,000 persons were evacuated from the area; 34 were injured. Damage to railroad property was estimated to be about $341,000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the man succeeded in moving the upper part of his body to the outside, the doors closed and locked on his right ankle, enabling the train to start. Since none of the crewmembers had observed the victim's entrapment, the conductor gave the &quot;all clear&quot; signal, and the engineer started the train.
The victim was dragged backward along and off the platform; then, he contacted the third rail and was electrocuted. The conductor, who was alerted by a person outside the train and by a passenger signaled the engineer, who stopped the train after it had traveled approximately 180 feet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
