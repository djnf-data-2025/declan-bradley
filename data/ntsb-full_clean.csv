The Sheffield Yard supervisor called 911; emergency medical services arrived on the scene and airlifted the conductor to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center, where he was admitted for treatment of his injuries. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were daylight and clear; the weather was 63°F with no precipitation.​The crew of yard job AH-01 consisted of an engineer and a conductor. At the time of the accident, the crew was using 2 locomotives to pull a cut of 55 mixed freight railcars out of track 5 of the receiving yard toward the hump lead track of Sheffield Yard.[3] The crew were preparing to switch 32 railcars at the front end of the cut of railcars onto track 4 of the receiving yard. The receiving yard had an eastward ascending grade toward the hump lead track. The engineer was in the lead locomotive and the conductor was on the ground giving instructions to the engineer through his radio. To perform the switching movement, the conductor needed to secure the 33rd railcar, which was a hopper car, by applying the hand brake located at the rear of the railcar.[4] Then, the conductor would have uncoupled the 32nd railcar from the 33rd railcar to facilitate the switching movement.[5] ​At the time of the accident, the engineer had moved the cut of railcars about 2,600 feet east when the conductor instructed the engineer to stop. The engineer stopped at 1:14:48 p.m. At 1:15:15 p.m., the conductor called for help through his radio. The engineer as well as employees in the yard tower at Sheffield Yard heard the conductor’s call for help. Employees at Sheffield Yard found the conductor on the north side of track 5 near the hopper car, where they observed that the hand brake on the hopper car was partially applied.While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators examined the track at the accident site, inspected the hopper car and tested the hand brake on the hopper car, reviewed data from the locomotive event recorder and radio communications between the conductor and the engineer, and completed interviews.

[1] The CG-3 switching crew was performing a shoving movement with two locomotives and five railcars on yard track 405, when the conductor became pinned between two railcars that the switching crew was attempting to couple. (See figure.) Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were clear with no precipitation; the temperature was 57°F.The CG-3 switching crew consisted of a conductor, a brakeman, and an engineer. Shortly before the accident, the switching crew shoved eight railcars onto track 406 and were planning to shove the remaining five railcars onto track 405. At the time of the accident, the engineer was operating the lead locomotive shoving north on track 405 and the brakeman was positioned on the ground at the switch to enter track 405. The conductor was located on the ground between tracks 405 and 406. The conductor was directing the movement on track 405 and communicating by radio with the engineer. After a short period transpired without radio communication from the conductor, the engineer stopped the train while the brakeman searched for the conductor. The brakeman found the conductor between the fifth (last) railcar being shoved and the railcar they were attempting to couple to the fifth car.​The couplers were bypassed (not aligned to permit a coupling to occur – also known as mismatched couplers) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators’ preliminary review of radio communications indicated that at no time during the sequence of events were there any announcements by the conductor to go in between equipment or separate 50 feet to fix mismatched couplers.[2] While on scene, NTSB investigators inspected the railcars involved in the accident; examined conditions of track 405; reviewed surveillance video footage and radio communications; retrieved the event recorder of lead locomotive 515; conducted a reenactment of the accident; reviewed crew training history and AAW training programs; company policies and procedures; and conducted interviews. The investigation is ongoing.

   ​​On March 11, 2025, about 3:03 p.m. local time, a Hulcher Services Inc. employee was seriously injured during a railcar rerailing operation at the Port of Stockton in Stockton, California.[1] At the time of the accident, the injured employee was part of an eight-member crew tasked with re-railing four railcars that had derailed at a switch on Track-840 the day prior. The injured employee was working with a rubber tire loader (loader) to move a previously re-railed car when he was struck and momentarily pinned between the end of the railcar and the loader. (See figure.) The employee was seriously injured, suffering internal injuries. At the time of this report, damage estimates were still being determined. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were clear, unobstructed, and sunny. The weather was 69°F with no precipitation.​Before the accident, the Central California Traction Company Railroad—the contract railroad company that performs industrial switching for the Port of Stockton—hired Hulcher Services to re-rail four railcars that had derailed at a switch on Track-840 on March 10, 2025, at about 7:00 pm; the injured employee was one of eight Hulcher Services employees assigned to the task.At the time of the accident, the injured employee was working with the loader to move a previously re-railed car to the west on Track-840 to make room for the rerailing of the fourth and final derailed car. The injured employee chained the loader to the knuckle of the railcar and signaled for the loader operator to back up leaving about 6 feet between the railcar and the loader. He then stepped between the equipment and operated the quick release lever on the hand brake of the railcar. Upon releasing the hand brake, the railcar began rolling west toward the loader. The injured employee was still between the equipment attempting to engage the hand brake on the railcar as it collided with the loader, striking and pinning the employee between the end of the railcar and the loader. The injured employee was transported to a nearby hospital by emergency services where he was diagnosed with six broken ribs and a collapsed lung; he was released several days later. ​While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators completed interviews and examined railroad equipment, the rubber tire loader, and Port of Stockton security video footage.

Train 3223 was traveling from West Trenton, New Jersey, to Newark, Delaware. There were about 325 passengers and 4 crew members on board the train. There were no injuries or fatalities. SEPTA estimated damages to equipment to be about $10 million. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were overcast with light mist; the temperature was 37°F.​The accident site had four main tracks and train 3223 was traveling on main track 4. Train 3223 consisted of 6 railcars.[2] The lead railcar (railcar 132) was followed by railcar 131, and railcar 288 was the rear railcar. About 4:55 p.m., there was a change of crew at Suburban Station, where crew 404 handed the train over to crew 462 (the crew operating the train at the time of the accident). Crew 462 consisted of an engineer, a conductor, an assistant conductor, and a conductor trainee.On the day of the accident, about 3:50 p.m., when the train was at Bethayres Station, the engineer of crew 404 contacted SEPTA’s Regional Rail Operations Control Center (RROCC) in Philadelphia and informed the dispatcher that the train was sluggish and not getting up to speed, and that a fault light on the train was on.[3] The dispatcher arranged for a mechanical maintenance team to inspect the train on the main track near SEPTA’s Roberts Yard.[4] About 4:31 p.m., the mechanical maintenance team completed their inspection and contacted the superintendent of train operations at the RROCC and reported that three railcars (132, 131, and 288) were “bad” and causing the slow acceleration of the train. However, the train continued to operate. About 5:07 p.m., when the train was at 30th Street Station, the engineer of crew 462 received a call from SEPTA’s chief dispatcher at the RROCC. The engineer reported that there was a strong burning smell in the lead railcar. The train still continued to operate en route.Shortly before the accident, about 5:48 p.m., as the train reached Crum Lynne Station, the engineer noticed haze behind the lead railcar. As the train departed Crum Lynne Station, the engineer saw smoke behind the lead railcar and stopped the train about 638 feet south of Crum Lynne Station. The engineer stepped down to inspect the train and, about 5:56 p.m., reported that the lead railcar was on fire.[5] The crew lowered the pantograph on the train and moved passengers to the rear railcars of the train.[6] The crew then established track protection on the adjacent track (main track 3) and evacuated the passengers through the rear of the train. Evacuation was complete about 6:22 p.m. and the fire was extinguished about 8:09 p.m.While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators examined railroad equipment and track conditions, reviewed data from surveillance cameras and the lead railcar’s event recorder, reviewed radio communications from train 3223, retrieved the inward-facing and outward-facing image recorders in the lead railcar for further investigation, and completed interviews. The National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation is ongoing.

​On December 18, 2024, about 5:00 p.m. local time, westbound Union Pacific Railroad (UP) train ZAILA-18 derailed after colliding with a northbound highway vehicle that was traversing the Cedar Street (or US Route 285) highway-railroad grade crossing in Pecos, Texas. Train ZAILA-18 struck a 2015 Peterbilt truck-tractor in combination with a 2016 Scheuerle hydraulic platform semitrailer (a combination vehicle) operated by Boss Heavy Haul LLC and transporting an oversize load. As a result of the collision, the 4 head-end locomotives and the first 11 railcars derailed, and the derailed locomotives released about 9,000 gallons of locomotive diesel fuel into the ground. The collision displaced the combination vehicle’s load, which struck a municipal building. The engineer and the conductor of train ZAILA-18 were fatally injured; three bystanders were transported to a local hospital, treated for minor injuries, and released. UP estimated damages to signals, equipment, and track to be about $4 million; Boss Heavy Haul LLC estimated damages to the combination vehicle and the load to be about $2.2 million.[1]  At the time of the accident, visibility was clear; the weather was 55°F with no precipitation.​Train ZAILA-18, crewed by an engineer and a conductor, was traveling from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Los Angeles, California. The train consisted of 4 locomotives and 47 intermodal railcars.[2] The consist included seven intermodal shipping containers carrying hazardous materials.[3] These containers did not breach or release hazardous materials. ​​The combination vehicle was traveling from Houston, Texas, to Mentone, Texas.[4]  A single driver operated the combination vehicle, which was escorted by two pilot vehicles and a uniformed police motorcycle escort. The load, a demethanizer tower, was 12 feet wide, 116 feet long, and 91,000 pounds.[5]The combination vehicle entered the highway-railroad grade crossing about 1 minute before the collision. The grade crossing was equipped with flashing lights, crossbucks, gates, and bells. The grade crossing’s warning equipment activated and signaled the train’s approach while the combination vehicle was blocking the railroad tracks. Preliminary review of event recorder data from the third locomotive showed that the train ZAILA-18 crew initiated an emergency braking application shortly before the collision, and the train slowed from about 68 mph to about 64 mph before striking the truck. [6] The maximum authorized speed in the area for railroad traffic was 70 mph.[7]While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators reviewed radio logs; conducted interviews; reviewed surveillance camera video; made sight-distance observations; examined the track, signals, locomotives, and railcars; examined the highway-railroad grade crossing and the combination vehicle; reviewed Boss Heavy Haul LLC’s policies, procedures, and training programs; and recovered data from the lead locomotive’s event recorder and external- and internal facing image recorders for further review.

At the time of the accident, visibility conditions were clear; the temperature was 62°F with no precipitation. 
   The maintenance crew consisted of a watchman and three roadway workers and was tasked with repairing nonfunctional train approach lights. The maintenance crew was using several forms of protection, including inspection clearance, which notifies train operators of maintenance activities, but does not prevent the trains from entering the work area at track speed. The maintenance crew was also using a form of protection called watchman lookout, in which a watchman is assigned who is responsible for warning the maintenance crew of approaching trains. Also, the maintenance crew was using train approach lights that are activated when a train was detected on the track circuit. At the time of the accident, two employees were actively engaged in repairs alongside the watchman lookout. (See figure.) A fourth employee was in the train control room preparing to de-energize a relay to help identify the malfunctioning lights and possible oncoming trains.​In an interview with National Transportation Safety Board investigators, the watchman said that he was focused on taking apart a light when the train exited the tunnel. In addition, he said that he had presumed that the train alert lights that were activated at the time of the incident were from the testing the fourth worker was performing in the train control room.

On October 1, 2024, about 4:46 p.m., eastbound Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) Green Line train 3874-3718 derailed its leading railcar at MBTA’s Red Bridge interlocking in Somerville, Massachusetts.[1] Train 3874-3718 was a light rail vehicle composed of two railcars. About 50 passengers and 2 crewmembers were on board. Less than a minute before the derailment, the train departed Lechmere Station in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and headed east along the MBTA Green Line. The train entered a 10-mph zone at 36 mph, passed through a double red signal (which requires a stop) west of the Red Bridge interlocking, and reached a switch that was still moving to direct the train into the diverging track as required by its route. When the train passed over the switch, the lead truck of its leading railcar continued straight, while the next two trucks of that same railcar took the diverging track and then derailed.[2] (See figure.) Seven passengers were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries; no other injuries were reported. Damage estimates were still being determined at the time of report publication. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were clear. The weather was about 62°F with no precipitation.​While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators completed interviews; reviewed data from locomotive event recorders, the signal system, and security cameras; and inspected railroad equipment and track conditions.The NTSB’s investigation is ongoing.

(See figure.) There were no other reported fatalities or injuries. At the time of the accident, and the temperature was 79°F with no precipitation. Although skies were clear with midday light, visibility was impeded by a grove of trees beside the tracks on the southern half of the curve.​At milepost 46.5, train MCHAL-04 had passed through a wayside defect detector, which detected an issue with the 51st railcar on the train. After receiving a hot-wheel alert from a UP dispatcher at 11:58 a.m., the conductor exited the locomotive, which was stopped on Main Track 1. He then walked across the adjacent Main Track 2 stood on the heads of the rail ties on the east side, and had the locomotive move forward so that he could examine the wheel on the 51st railcar.[1]  As the conductor was waiting to examine the suspected hot wheel, train M338, with the cab car in the leading position, rounded the curve and struck him.[2]​​Following the accident, on September 5, 2024, UP issued a safety alert to brief their employees on the accident and reinforce the applicable operating/safety rules relevant to the investigation. Since METRA is operated by UP employees, the safety alert was applicable to those employees as well. 
   While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators conducted inspections of equipment, track, and signals, including the wayside defect detector at milepost 46.5. They also conducted sight distance observations with an exemplar METRA train, reviewed surveillance cameras, event recorders, inward- and outward-facing image recorders, and radio communications. The NTSB also conducted interviews and reviewed the training records, policies, and procedures for both UP and METRA. The NTSB’s investigation is ongoing. Future investigative activity will focus on adjacent track protection rules where changes may possibly mitigate the risk for train crews on the ground.[3]Parties to the investigation include:​the Federal Railroad Administration; UP; METRA; the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers; and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. [1] A hot wheel on a railcar refers to the overheating of its wheels. This typically happens because of overheating is severe, it can lead to thermal cracking of the wheels. A hot wheel alert is a notification provided to a train crew to inform them that a hot wheel has been detected on the train. [2] A cab car, also sometimes known as a control car, is a nonpowered rail vehicle from which a train can be operated. Since Metra train M338 was led by the cab car, its approach was not as loud as it may have been had it been led by a locomotive. [3] An adjacent track is one whose center is spaced less than 25 feet from the center of the occupied track. However, it is often used to refer to any track that is located close to another track. It is vital for adjacent tracks to be identified to ensure the safety of workers and the proper coordination of train movements, especially when maintenance or other activities are being conducted on or near the tracks.

      On July 6, 2024, about 1:36 a.m. local time, a Union Pacific Railroad (UP) conductor was fatally injured during a shoving operation in UP’s Proviso Yard in Melrose Park, Illinois.1 At the time of the accident, Train MPRNL-06 was traveling east out of Proviso Yard 4, Track 12, onto the South Melrose Track. At the same time, Train MCBCH-05 was shoving west on the City Lead Track toward Track 12. The conductor of train MCBCH-05 was positioned on the leading end of a tank car when the car ran into the left side of train MPRNL-06, fatally injuring the train MCBCH-05 conductor. (See figure.) No further injuries were reported. At the time of this report, UP estimated accident damages at over $71,000. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were clear, unobstructed, and dark; the only direct lighting available was from a single lantern and headlamp in use by the train MCBCH-05 conductor at the time of the accident. The weather was 64°F with no precipitation. 
      ​Train MPRNL-06’s consist included 64 loaded cars and 27 empties for a total of 91 railcars; Train MCBCH-05’s consist included 33 loaded cars and 12 empties for a total of 45 railcars. Each train had a two-person crew: an engineer and a conductor. 
      On the day of the accident, train MPRNL-06 was scheduled to depart Track 12, after which the crew of train MCBCH-05 was scheduled to tie down on Track 12, cut the engines away, and relocate the engines to the diesel shop. Prior to the accident, the Proviso Yard controller (formally known as the yardmaster) provided a job briefing to the crew of train MCBCH-05, where he instructed the crew to stop and wait at the top of the City Lead Track, which ties into the South Melrose Track before entering Proviso Yard 4. Once train MPRNL-06 was clear, train MCBCH-05 was to shove into Track 12 in Proviso Yard 4.  
      Once train MCBCH-05 pulled past the Melrose Park Metro Station, the conductor got on the rear of the train, waited for a signal from the dispatcher to begin moving, then shoved the train west onto City Lead Track. As part of the shoving movement, train MCBCH-05 was traveling northwest up a winding incline on City Lead Track with the conductor riding the leading end and protecting the shove movement. The conductor ultimately shoved the train past the top of City Lead Track and into the left side of train MPRNL-06 just prior to the switch between City Lead Track and South Melrose Track, fatally injuring the train MCBCH-05 conductor.​ 
      ​While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators reviewed event recorder data and radio communications, training programs, and company operating procedures; conducted an accident reenactment, a track inspection, and a sight-distance observation; and completed interviews.

The struck employee was the foreman of a CSX crosstie replacement team that was using the ballast regulator and other equipment to perform track resurfacing and crosstie replacement near milepost 81.61 on a CSX North End Subdivision industry spur track.  Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were clear, and the temperature was 51°F.

(b) A ballast regulator is a piece of MOW equipment that evenly distributes ballast, or crushed stone, along a railroad track bed. (c) Gage is the distance between the heads of rails. Standard gage in the United States and Canada is 4 feet 8.5 inches, measured at a point 0.625 inches below the top of the rail.[2] The crosstie replacement team consisted of a foreman and 53 roadway workers and equipment operators.","<p>We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the CSX Transportation maintenance-of-way employee (foreman) fatality was the ballast regulator operator’s lack of awareness that the foreman was standing in the gage of the track before the ballast regulator operator initiated an unannounced reverse movement and the foreman’s lack of awareness of the ballast regulator moving toward him. Contributing to the accident were incomplete communications regarding the movement of the ballast regulator at the 10th Street highway–rail grade crossing. Further contributing to the accident was a nonoperational change-of-direction alarm that did not sound, and the lack of sound from the horn, when the machine reversed direction.​<br><br></p>",NA,NA,"<p>​​After the accident, on February 15, 2024, the Fatality Analysis of Maintenance-of-Way Employees and Signalmen Committee issued an alert regarding the preliminary details of the accident to raise awareness and the importance of maintaining vigilance while working on or about tracks and around roadway maintenance machines.[3]<br></p><p>After the accident, CSX issued a safety alert describing the accident and emphasizing the importance of being aware of one’s surroundings and of conducting “what if” scenario assessments to identify risks associated with the planned work. CSX also made changes to several of their rules, including increasing the red zone distance around roadway maintenance machines from 15 feet to 25 feet.[4]  CSX also now requires employees to conduct additional job briefings midway through shifts, to alert employees to changes in work plans, and instructs MOW machine operators to sound the machine’s horns if the CDA becomes inoperative. </p><p>In January 2025, NTSB investigators attended CSX’s demonstration of a new collision avoidance system that incorporates object and employee detection technology and automatic antilock braking. The system uses advanced proprietary technology to maintain separation between MOW machines and employees.

Release date: 25 January 2024On January 4, 2024, about 3:00 p.m., northbound New York City Transit (NYCT) non-revenue train 1345 collided with northbound passenger train 1427 on the Number 1 Line north of 96th Street Station in Manhattan, New York.[1] Train 1427 was crossing over from express track 3 to local track 4 when train 1345 overran a red signal at the north end of the station platform, entered the crossover, and struck the fifth railcar of train 1427.[2] Train 1345 derailed two railcars and train 1427 derailed three railcars. About 22 passengers and 3 crew members suffered minor injuries. At the time of this report, NYCT had not estimated the cost of damages. The collision occurred in the underground subway system, so weather was not a factor.​Passenger train 1427 comprised 10 railcars and its crew consisted of a conductor and an operator. The train was carrying about 200 passengers at the time of the collision. Train 1345 was also a 10-railcar train, and its crew consisted of a transit system supervisor, an operator (who was acting as a flagger), a conductor, and a railcar inspector.[3]Before the collision, about 2:11 p.m., an unruly passenger aboard train 1345 triggered an emergency braking application by pulling the emergency brake valve cords on the first five railcars.[4] These emergency brake valve cords are accessible to passengers within each railcar. After the operator of train 1345 was unable to reset the emergency braking application, the operator moved the train to 79th Street Station and offloaded all passengers. A railcar inspector with NYCT arrived on scene but was also unable to reset the brakes, placing the train into bad order (out-of-service) status.[5]The operations control center instructed the railcar inspector to cut out the brakes and traction motors on the five railcars in the front portion of the train so it could be operated. The inspector was then instructed to move the out-of-service train to a rail yard for repairs. After the railcar inspector performed the cut out, train 1345 departed 79th Street Station at restricted speed, northbound on track 4 toward 96th Street Station, destined for a nearby yard.6 The transit system supervisor was operating the controls of the sixth railcar. The flagger was positioned in the lead railcar and communicating with the transit system supervisor to coordinate the train’s movements. In interviews with National Transportation Safety Board investigators, the flagger said he lost radio communications with the transit system supervisor near 96th Street Station. The transit system supervisor did not receive the flagger’s instruction to stop, the train passed by a signal requiring a stop at the end of the 96th Street Station platform, and the collision occurred. The track in the area was equipped with trip-stops, which activate a train’s emergency brakes if the train passes through a signal requiring a stop. Because the brakes on the first five railcars had been cut out, emergency brakes could not be activated by the trip-stop. While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators requested security camera images and radio audio recordings; reviewed signal logs; reviewed​ NYCT operating procedures; conducted sight distance observations; inspected both trains and tested the brakes on the last five railcars of train 1345; tested the portable radios used by the crew of train 1345; and completed interviews. Neither train was equipped with event recorders, cameras, or other recording devices. ​​The National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation is ongoing. Future investigative activity will focus on NYCT’s operating procedures when moving bad order cars, radio communication procedures, mechanical procedures when placing a revenue train in bad order status, and the lack of federal requirements for railcar event recorders on FTA regulated properties. Parties to the investigation include:the Federal Transit Administration, the New York State Public Transportation Safety Board, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York City Transit, and Transport Workers Union Local 100.​ [1] (a) All times in this report are local. (b) A non-revenue train is any train in test, maintenance, emergency, or inspection service that may not be used by the public. ​[2] Under NYCT operating rules, a red signal at the entrance of an interlocking (in this case, a crossover) requires a train to stop.​[3] The flagger was communicating over a handheld radio with the supervisor about signals, obstructions, and other information needed to operate the train.

Release Date: Dec. 20, 2023​On November 29, 2023, about 12:13 a.m., northbound New York City Transit (NYCT) passenger train No. 2317-D struck and fatally injured an NYCT employee working as a flagger on a cleaning crew on track B2 of the D line near the 34th Street-Herald Square Station in Manhattan, New York. As the train entered the cleaning crew’s work zone, it experienced an uncommanded brakes-in-emergency (BIE) application.  When the operator exited the train to see what caused the BIE application, they saw that the employee was under the train and unresponsive. The employee was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment and pronounced dead. No other injuries were reported. The accident took place in an underground tunnel, visibility conditions were dark, and weather was not a factor.​Train movements in the area of the accident are authorized by wayside signal indications and coordinated and controlled by the 34th street tower operator. The track is equipped with permanent trip blocks controlled and actuated by the signal system; these trip blocks trigger a BIE application if a train moves through a signal requiring a stop. 
   The track cleanup crew consisted of 12 employees tasked with removing debris from track B2. The crew went on duty at 10:00 p.m. and set up portable yellow flagging lights and a portable trip block south of the work zone.  The flagger was equipped with a red light and positioned between the northernmost yellow flagging lights and the rest of the cleanup crew. (See figure 2.) ​​Figure 2. Diagram of the accident scene. 
   Train No. 2317-D was composed of eight type R-68 railcars with no event recorders or cameras. Its crew consisted of an operator and a conductor who started their shifts at 4:10 p.m. on November 28, 2023, at Bedford Park Terminal. Based on witness statements and interviews with National Transportation Safety Board investigators, the train approached the work zone about 12:10 a.m. on the day of the accident, slowing and stopping short of the red light held by the flagger. The flagger signaled to the track foreman that a train needed authorization to traverse the work zone.  The foreman cleared the cleanup crew from the track and signaled to the flagger to let the train pass. The flagger extinguished the red light, removed the portable trip block, and signaled to the train to proceed. While on scene, National Transportation Safety Board investigators inspected the accident train; reviewed security camera footage, audio recordings, and signal logs; conducted a reenactment of the accident; measured lighting at the accident scene; reviewed NYCT procedures related to worker protection; examined working conditions at the accident scene; and conducted interviews. The National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation is ongoing. Future investigative activity will focus on NYCT’s internal oversight and worker protection procedures, and the external oversight of NYCT provided by the Federal Transit Administration and the New York Department of Transportation. Parties to the investigation include: ​the Federal Transit Administration, the New York Department of Transportation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, NYCT, and the Transport Workers Union Local 100.[1] (a) All times in this report are local times. (b) A railroad flagger, also known as a railroad flagman, is responsible for ensuring the safety of crews working on or near the railroad track. 
​[2] BIE is NYCT’s term for an emergency braking application. An emergency braking application uses all available braking force to stop a train as quickly as possible.
​[3] A trip block is a track-mounted safety device that causes a BIE application if a train traverses a trip block in the up position. A trip block works by actuating an external valve handle mounted on the underside a railcar, activating the train’s brakes.
[4] Portable yellow flagging lights are used to notify train operators that they are approaching a location where they must stop unless they receive a signal to proceed. If a stop is required, NYCT rules require operators to stop no more than one railcar length from the red light held by the flagger.

Release Date 18 July 2023On June 26, 2023, about 8:05 p.m. local time, a CSX Transportation (CSX) conductor trainee on CSX yard job Y231 was killed while riding the lead railcar during a shoving movement at Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland. [1] (See figure 1.) The conductor trainee fell from an intermodal railcar during the movement and was struck by the train. [2] Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were daylight and clear; the weather was 84°F with intermittent rain showers earlier that day.​The crew of yard job Y231 consisted of an engineer in the locomotive cab, a conductor, and the conductor trainee. The train was composed of 2 locomotives and 15 empty intermodal railcars. Seagirt Marine Terminal surveillance camera data reviewed by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators showed that the crew was in the process of shoving the railcars around a curve, with the conductor and conductor trainee protecting the shoving movement.[3] The conductor was on the west side of the lead railcar (the right side in the direction of travel). The conductor trainee was controlling the shoving movement from the east side of the lead railcar (the left side in the direction of travel) with one foot on the second step of the railcar and one foot on the platform. [4] (See figure 2.) The conductor trainee communicated instructions using his handheld radio that they needed to stop within 5 railcar lengths.[5]  As the train slowed, the conductor trainee fell from his position and was struck by the train. ​Figure 2. Photo of investigator on the intermodal railcar during reenactment of the accident.While on scene, NTSB investigators reviewed data from surveillance cameras, the locomotive event recorder, and the forward-facing image recorder of the lead locomotive; conducted a static reenactment of the accident to understand the position of the conductor trainee on the intermodal railcar and a dynamic reenactment of the movement of the equipment involved in the accident; and completed interviews. 
   As a result of this accident, on July 6, 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration issued “Safety Bulletin 2023-04: Trainee Switching Fatality Involving a Shove Movement in a Yard,” advising railroads and employees to review applicable training and follow safety procedures for riding equipment.[6]   On July 1, 2023, the Switching Operations Fatalities Analysis Working Group issued an alert, advising employees to remain vigilant during switching operations and to conduct job briefings whenever a job changes. [7]The NTSB’s investigation is ongoing. Fu​ture investigative activity will focus on the industry-wide operational rules and training for conductors riding equipment, and the design and riding configuration of the railcar involved in this accident. Parties to the investigation include the Federal Railroad Administration; CSX; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen; and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers.  ​ [1] (a) A shoving movement is the process of pushing railcars or a train from the rear with a locomotive. (b) Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore is managed by Ports America. The track is owned and inspected by Canton Railroad.
​ [2] An intermodal railcar is designed to carry shipping containers used in intermodal freight transportation. The intermodal railcars in this accident were each made up of three to five connected single-unit railcars; all railcars in the accident train were empty.​ [3] A crew member protects a shoving movement by visually determining that the route is clear of obstructions and conflicting movements.  [4] A crew member controls a shoving movement by giving instructions to the engineer.
 [5] Crews commonly use railcar lengths to communicate distances.

Three tank cars carrying flammable and combustible hazardous materials were mechanically breached during the derailment. A fire ignited during the derailment and grew to involve lading released from these three mechanically breached tank cars, additional derailed tank cars carrying both hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and freight cars. Emergency responders established a 1-mile evacuation zone that affected about 2,000 residents. The derailed equipment included five hazardous materials tank cars carrying vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), a compressed liquified flammable gas offered for shipment as “UN1086 vinyl chloride, stabilized, 2.1.” The five VCM tank cars were not mechanically breached during the derailment, but over the next day, four of these tank cars were exposed to fires and released material from pressure relief devices. These releases ceased on the afternoon of February 4. Acting on information provided by NS and its contractors that a dangerous chemical reaction was occurring within a VCM tank car, the incident commander managing the response chose to expand the evacuation zone and perform a vent and burn (a deliberate breach of a tank car) on all five derailed VCM tank cars.

No injuries were reported; one passenger was transported to the hospital, treated, and released.","<p>​The derailment occurred because the wheels of one wheelset had migrated outward on their axle, resulting in a width larger than the design specification. The wheel migration happened over time, eventually causing the wheelset to exceed its maximum design width. When this wheelset traveled over a turnout (a type of special track work that allows a train to change tracks), the out-of-specification wheelset width caused a wheel to leave the rail, derailing a railcar.

Of the eight passenger railcars that derailed, four derailed on their sides, one derailed leaning, and three derailed upright.","<p>​The derailment occurred because of a combination of conditions that affected the BNSF Railway track. These conditions included worn rail, vertical track deflection at a four-bolt rail joint, subgrade instability, and track misalignment. Also, we found that had a locomotive equipped with an existing automated vehicle/track interaction monitoring system traveled the derailment curve on the day of the derailment, the deteriorating track conditions could have been identified and BNSF Railway could have been notified, giving it the opportunity to take action to mitigate the dangers of the misaligned track.</p><p>We also found that rail wear limit regulations would have required the worn rail to be replaced before there was wheel flange contact with the four-bolt joint bars.

The employee was found by an NYCT car inspector who then radioed management of the unresponsive employee between tracks 52 and 53. The unresponsive employee was identified as a transit car cleaner (CTA).  Emergency medical services personnel were notified, arrived on the scene, and declared the CTA employee deceased.The CTA was found lying near a light pole and several current collector assemblies mounted on nearby rail transit cars. Current collectors draw power from an electrified rail (third rail) on NYCT’s transit system, and, should any current collector from a train be in contact with the third rail, then all assemblies on every car, even those not in contact with the rail, have the potential to be energized by electric current. The nearest current collector was about 12 inches from the light pole. Electric current collectors are used by trolley buses, trams, or electric locomotives to carry electrical power from overhead lines or electrical third rails to the electrical equipment of the vehicles.
​The CTA was found wearing an NYCT-issued reflective safety vest and safety boots and was in possession of his assigned cleaning equipment. His cleaning equipment and radio were observed laying in the immediate area he was found. The radio was in the on position; however, the battery was depleted.

One of the derailed railcars struck the bridge structure, and part of the bridge collapsed, dropping railcars and bridge structure onto Rio Salado Parkway below and temporarily shutting down the road. Five of the derailed railcars were DOT-111 tank cars carrying various hazardous materials.[2] Two of these tank cars, both carrying UN1915 cyclohexanone, a flammable hazardous material, fell from the bridge during the​ ​​derailment; the rest remained in-line with the track. [3] One of the fallen DOT-111 tank cars released about 2,200 gallons of cyclohexanone, creating a pool of hazardous material below the damaged bridge. The cyclohexanone did not ignite, and no other tank cars were breached. Derailed lumber cars, which remained on the bridge, caught fire during the derailment. Some lumber fell onto and near the road, where it burned for several hours. (See figure 1.) There were no fatalities; one firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation at the scene.

The striking train consisted of 3 leading locomotives and 105 railcars. The locomotive engineer and conductor of the striking train were killed, and 3 locomotives and railcars 1 through 57 of the striking train derailed while the rear 5 railcars and the railcars positioned 8, 9, and 10 from the rear of the stationary train derailed. Damage was estimated by Union Pacific Railroad to be $3.2 million.As the train descended the grade, the locomotive engineer initiated a full-service brake application, however, the train’s speed continued to increase. At milepost 529.95 the train was still accelerating, reaching 28 mph when the locomotive engineer initiated an emergency brake application. The event recorder indicated that information was being transmitted between the controlling locomotive and the rear railcar via a telemetry link for the previous 45 minutes. After the emergency brake application, the status of the communications system changed to “FR NC,” which means front-to-rear no communication. The emergency brake request was not received at the end-of-train device, which would have initiated an emergency brake application at the rear of the train. Five minutes after the locomotive engineer initiated the emergency brake application, the end-of-train device still had not received the emergency brake request, and the train collided with the standing train at about 55 mph at milepost 527.1. Prior to the collision, the crew of the striking Union Pacific Railroad freight train reported problems with the train’s air brake system and radioed the Union Pacific Railroad Harriman Dispatch Center to advise that they had accelerated to 51 mph and were unable to stop. The Union Pacific Railroad Harriman Dispatch Center notified the crew of Union Pacific freight train MPCNP03 and advised them to evacuate the train to avoid possible injury from the runaway train.","<p>We&#160;determined&#160;that the probable cause of the collision was the failure of the Union Pacific train MGRCY04 air brake system due to an air flow restriction in the brake pipe and the failure of the end-of-train device to respond to an emergency brake command. Contributing to the accident was the failure of Union Pacific Railroad to maintain the railcars in accordance with federal regulations, including regularly performing single railcar air brake tests. Further contributing to the accident were communication protocols, set by Federal Railroad Administration regulations and industry standards, that allowed extended time intervals for loss of communication notification between the head-of-train device and the end-of-train device without warning the train crew of the loss of communication.​<br></p>","<p>​We made new recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration and the Association of American Railroads, the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association and the Association of American Railroads.<br></p>",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,"Thu",0-01-01 19:40:00

The accident occurred on main track 1 at milepost 119.2 on the Philadelphia to Washington line, located on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor. At the time of the accident, main track 2 was out of service under a continuous track outage for track maintenance, and the adjacent tracks immediately to the east and west of main track 2 (main tracks 1 and 3, respectively) were in service for train movements. Three watchmen were protecting the roadway workers and watching for trains moving on adjacent tracks to warn workers of approaching trains. One watchman was positioned near the boarding platform, another was positioned in a nearby curve, and the third watchman was positioned toward the end of the curve, near a work gang of welders. The third watchman was the employee struck by the train. No passengers or crewmembers on Amtrak train 86 were injured.Amtrak train 86 departed Washington, D.C.’s Union Station about 8:40 a.m., destined for New York’s Penn Station.

As a result of the collision, the engineer and the conductor from the southbound train died, and the engineer and the conductor from the northbound train were seriously injured.The following safety issues are covered in the report: Fatigue and Employee Work Schedules: Regulatory requirements to use science-based tools, such as biomathematical models, are needed to reduce start time variability that results in irregular work-rest cycles and train crew fatigueMedical Issues: Regulatory requirements for screening, evaluating, and ensuring adequate treatment standards for sleep apnea and other sleep disorders for railroad employees in safety-sensitive positionsUnion Pacific Railroad Medical Rules: Union Pacific Railroad needs: (1) medical rules that would require railroad employees in safety-sensitive positions to report all diagnosed sleep disorders; and (2) to perform periodic evaluations to ensure the condition is appropriately treatedAutomated Systems that Reset Alertness Devices: An automatic horn sequencer prevented the operation of an electronic alertness device that was designed to help the southbound train crewmembers maintain vigilance in the locomotive cab by monitoring engineer activity and applying the train brakes should the device fail to detect activity for a predetermined period of timePositive Train Control: A functioning positive train control system would have prevented this accident​.","<p>​We determined&#160;that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the southbound train crewmembers to respond to the signal indications requiring them to slow and stop their train prior to control point Y-229 because they were fatigued and had fallen asleep due to (1) the locomotive engineer’s inadequately treated obstructive sleep apnea, (2) the conductor’s irregular work schedule, and (3) the train crew operating in the early morning hours when they were predisposed to sleep. Contributing to the accident was (1) the lack of a functioning positive train control system; (2) the use of an automatic horn sequencer that, when activated, negated the operation of an electronic alertness device; (3) the Federal Railroad Administration’s failure to promulgate rules regarding sleep disorders; and (4) the absence of federal regulations requiring freight railroads to use fatigue modeling tools for train crew work schedules.​<br><br></p>","<p>​​As a result of the investigation of this accident, we&#160;made&#160;new safety recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration; BNSF Railway, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, CSX Transportation, Kansas City Southern Railway, Intercity Railroads, and Commuter Railroads; Class I Railroads; and Union Pacific Railroad.
