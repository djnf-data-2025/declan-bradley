tTrainSighting,cars,List<FullCarSighting>,List of cars ordered as they were ordered in the train.
tTrainSighting,warnings,List<LegacyTrainSightingWarning> (Optional),[DEPRECATED] Warnings about irregularities of the train sighting.
tTrainSighting,issues,List<TrainSightingWarning>,Warnings about irregularities of the train sighting and potential data issues.
tTrainSighting,lastModified,Instant (Optional),Time of the last modification of the train sighting data in UTC.
tTrainSighting,estimatedDimensions,EquipmentDimensions,Estimated total dimensions (length, weight, capacity, ...) of the train.
tTrainSighting,gallonageCapacity,Double (Optional),Liquid capacity in gallons. Populated only for tank cars.
tTrainSighting,cubicFeetCapacity,Double (Optional),Capacity of the inner space in cubic feet. Populated only for some car types such as box cars, gondolas, and hoppers. Not populated for tank cars.
tTrainSighting,loadLimitTons,Double (Optional),Load limit of the equipment in (short) tons. For intermodal cars, it is the load limit of the entire car, not just individual platforms.
tTrainSighting,tareWeightTons,Double (Optional),Tare weight of the equipment in (short) tons. For intermodal cars, it is the weight of the entire car, not just individual platforms.

tCars,carPosition,Int,Unique integer identifier of a car's position in the stack.
tCars,type,CarType,The type of the sighted car or a locomotive.
tCars,carId,String (Optional),Car or locomotive identifier read by OCR. Null, if the identifier is unknown.
tCars,hazmats,List<HazMatPlacard> (Optional),Information about detected hazmat placards attached to the train car. If null, the hazmat detection was not performed. If empty list, the hazmat detection was performed but no placards were found.
tCars,containers,List<ContainerSighting> (Optional),Data about shipping containers loaded on the train car. If null, container detection was not performed. If empty list, then no containers were identified.
tCars,owner,RailId (Optional),The owner of the rail car or locomotive. Currently supported only for locomotives.
tCars,isLoaded,Boolean (Optional),The empty/loaded status of the train car. True, if the train car is loaded. False, if the car is empty. Null if the loaded status is unknown, or if it does not make sense to distinguish for the concrete car type (e.g. locomotives).
tCars,equipmentParameters,EquipmentParameters (Optional),Additional parameters of the train car or the locomotive.
